# Icon Setup Instructions

## Your DinoScan Logo
I can see your beautiful DinoScan icon with:
- Vibrant purple to teal gradient background
- Clean "DINO SCAN" typography
- Professional design perfect for VS Code

## Next Steps:
1. Save the icon image you provided as `icon.png` in this directory
2. Ensure it's 128x128 pixels (VS Code will resize if needed)
3. The package.json is already configured to use this file

## Quick Setup:
Right-click on your icon image → Save As → `icon.png` in this folder

The extension is ready to build once the icon is in place!
