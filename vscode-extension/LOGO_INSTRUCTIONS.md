# DinoScan Logo Usage Instructions

## Converting Your Logo for VS Code Extension

Your beautiful DinoScan logo needs to be converted to the proper format for VS Code extensions.

### Required Formats:
- **Primary Icon**: `icon.png` - 128x128 pixels (referenced in package.json)
- **Marketplace Icon**: Same file, will be automatically resized by VS Code Marketplace

### Steps to Convert Your Logo:

1. **Save your current logo image** to `vscode-extension/icon.png`
2. **Resize to 128x128 pixels** using any image editor:
   - Photoshop: Image > Image Size > 128x128 pixels
   - GIMP: Image > Scale Image > 128x128 pixels  
   - Online tools: TinyPNG, Canva, etc.
3. **Ensure PNG format** with transparent background if desired
4. **Test the icon** by building the extension

### Logo Guidelines:
- ✅ **Square aspect ratio** (1:1) - 128x128 pixels
- ✅ **PNG format** for transparency support
- ✅ **Clean visibility** at small sizes (16x16 when scaled down)
- ✅ **Distinctive colors** that work in both light and dark themes
- ✅ **Simple design** that remains recognizable when small

### Current Logo Analysis:
Your gradient logo with "Dino SCAN" text looks perfect! The vibrant colors and clear typography will work excellently as an extension icon. The gradient from purple to teal is very eye-catching and professional.

### Quick Conversion Commands:

#### Using ImageMagick (if installed):
```bash
# Resize to 128x128
magick your-logo.png -resize 128x128 vscode-extension/icon.png
```

#### Using online tools:
1. Go to https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
2. Upload your logo
3. Set dimensions to 128x128 pixels
4. Download and save as `vscode-extension/icon.png`

Once you add the icon file, the extension will display your beautiful DinoScan branding in:
- VS Code Extension Marketplace
- Extensions view in VS Code
- Command palette
- Status bar (as configured)

The current package.json is already configured to use `icon.png`, so just add your converted image to complete the branding!
